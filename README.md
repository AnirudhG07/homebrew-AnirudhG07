# homebrew-AnirudhG07

This repository serves as Homebrew tap for all formula's and packages I (AnirudhG07) create.
<br>Homebrew serves as an awesome package manager for MacOS only.
## Downloading packages
To download any packages using Homebrew from my tap, first tap my directory by running the following command-
```bash
brew tap AnirudhG07/AnirudhG07
```
Once this is done, if you want to download a `formula` from `Formula` directory, you can run the following command-
```bash
brew install formula # formula.rb will be present in Formula
```
Now this should install the `formula` package in your device based on dependencies for each of the formula(mentioned in respective github repo's).

### Conflicting name 
If Homebrew-core contains originally a formula/package with the same name as a package of mine, you can download the Homebrew-core one using-
```bash
brew install formula # where formula = package/tool/etc.
```
To install package of my name, you can run the following command-
```bash
brew install AnirudhG07/AnirudhG07/formula
```
This should download by package with the same name.
